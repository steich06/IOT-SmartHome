Task 1 – Business Context Description
Project: Smart Plant Care System (SPCS)

Overview
SPCS is an IoT-based Smart Home solution that monitors **soil moisture** and **light level** using a device simulator.  
Users can view real-time data and send **manual watering commands** (simulated).  
The goal is to help home users keep their plants healthy with minimal effort.

Problem Statement
Home users often forget to water plants or water them incorrectly.  
This project provides real-time sensor data and simple watering control to reduce guesswork.

Target Users
- Home Users who want easy plant care  
- Developers who integrate the REST API  
- Business Owner planning product improvements  

Key Use Cases
- View current soil moisture & light level  
- Receive “low moisture” status  
- Send simulated watering commands  
- View historical sensor data  

User Stories
- As a home user, I want to see real-time soil moisture so that I know when my plant needs water.  
- As a home user, I want to manually trigger simulated watering so that I can care for my plant remotely.  
- As a developer, I want clear REST API documentation so that I can integrate the system easily.  

Value Proposition
SPCS simplifies plant care and helps users make informed decisions using real-time IoT data.
