# Task 3 – MQTT Broker / Azure IoT Hub Infrastructure

For this project we use **Azure IoT Hub** as the MQTT-based broker for the Smart Plant Care System (SPCS).

## 1. Chosen Option

According to the assignment, the MQTT broker infrastructure can be:
- VM based  
- Docker based  
- Azure IoT Hub  

In this project we chose: **Azure IoT Hub**, because it is a managed PaaS service and it matches the reference exercise from the course repository (`6-paas-iot-hub`).

## 2. IoT Hub Setup

- Subscription: `Azure for Students`  
- Resource Group: `rg-smart-plant-iot`  
- IoT Hub Name: `spcs-iot-hub-yunus-doruk`  
- Region: `Switzerland North`  
- Tier: `Free (F1)`  

The IoT Hub acts as the central MQTT endpoint for our IoT Device Simulator.

## 3. Device Identity (IoT Device Simulator)

We created one device identity for the simulator:

- Device ID: `spcs-simulator-1`  
- Authentication: **Symmetric key**, auto-generated by Azure  
- Status: **Enabled**  

The device **primary connection string** is **not committed to GitHub** for security reasons.  
It will be used in Task 4 by the IoT Device Simulator to connect using MQTT over TLS (port 8883).

Example device connection string:

```text
HostName=spcs-iot-hub-yunus-doruk.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=spcs-simulator-1;SharedAccessKey=<SECRET>
